## About Me.


##### Hi, I am a B-TECH graduate in Electrical Engineering and currently working as a Support Engineer (Cyber Forensics and Electrical Engineering) for about 1 month in CDAC Silchar.

It all started in 2019 when I got selected in CDAC Silchar  as a Cyber Shikskaa student. Where I got exposure to Information Security Awareness, Graphic design, UI design, Cyber forensic etc. That expanded my view upon the possibilities of getting into such things.

Then I slowly started engaging myself into Adobe suits like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Aftereffects and attended almost every Information Security Awareness program from ISEA.
